# NeuropriceX
Intelligent pricing powered by learning, not guesswork.

Neuro refers ---> Refers to neural networks, adaptive learning, and brain-inspired intelligence

price----> Your core function—optimizing ticket prices

X ---> Denotes innovation, experimentation,

🗺️# Project Overview

Goal: Build a real-time, scalable, fair, and explainable dynamic pricing engine that:

- Optimizes ticket pricing using Reinforcement Learning
- Personalizes offers using user profiles and real-time demand signals
- Explains pricing logic with XAI techniques for transparency
- Scales using DevOps pipelines and containerized microservices


# 🧠 NeuroPriceX: Intelligent Dynamic Pricing for Event Tickets 🎟️

NeuroPriceX is a real-time, reinforcement learning–powered dynamic pricing engine built for modern ticketing platforms. It learns from live demand patterns, user behavior, and contextual signals to **optimize ticket prices**, **maximize revenue**, and **maintain fairness and transparency**.

Whether you're running a music festival, a stadium match, or a local comedy show—**this engine adapts to your market in real time**, just like your audience does.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🎯 **Reinforcement Learning-Based Pricing**  
  Adaptive policy trained using PPO to make dynamic pricing decisions under uncertainty.

- 🧠 **Explainable AI (XAI)**  
  Users and organizers get full transparency into why each price was chosen — powered by SHAP.

- 🧍 **User-Level Personalization**  
  Prices adapt to user segments, loyalty scores, and behavioral patterns using real-time embeddings.

- 📈 **Live Demand Tracking**  
  Features integrate time-to-event, seat demand, weather, social sentiment, and more.

- ⚙️ **Scalable Cloud Deployment**  
  Dockerized and deployable via CI/CD to AWS ECS or Lambda for high availability.

- 🤝 **Fairness & Ethics Built-In**  
  Pricing guardrails, refund logic, and community-based discounts support responsible AI design.
